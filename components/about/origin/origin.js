            Why are all technology, innovation, and incubation hubs based in Nairobi? Nairobi is not Kenya and Kenya is not Nairobi. Something has to change. Aha moment that inspired the founding of Swahilipot.

            In 2016, Mahmoud Noor (alias Mentor001) took action and founded Swahilipot with support from National Museums of Kenya (NMK), Seacom, ICT Authority, and Cisco.

            Swahilipot started as a community-based organization (CBO) with programs focused on technology & innovation. It has grown over the years to become a non-profit organization (NGO) with diverse program areas and reach.
